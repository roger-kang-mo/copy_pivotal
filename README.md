> Pioneers take the arrows, settlers take the land

# Description
This extension copies the Pivotal story ID from your branch into your pull request body. More specifically, the really complex adds the story ID to the string "[*Pivotal Story*](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/)".

It does this by pulling the story ID from the URL. So, for this to work, your branch name has to follow the convention of `(chore|bug|feature|whatever)/(story ID)-(nobody cares what you put here)`

# Installation
